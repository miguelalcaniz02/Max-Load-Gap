## Introduction

This GitHub project consists on a pdf report called Alca√±izMiguel-maxload.pdf, a python file called max_load.py and this ReadMe.

In this programming assignment, it is written a Python program to see different values of max load gap in different scenareos.

## Requirements

This project requires Python to be installed and the following Python libraries:
- `math`
- `random`
- `numpy` (`np`)
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

pip install numpy matplotlib scipy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```python
   git clone https://github.com/miguelalcaniz02/Max-Load-Gap.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```python
   cd Max-Load-Gap

3. Install python and the necessary dependencies (as shown in the Requirements). E.g.:
   ```python
   pip install numpy matplotlib scipy

## Usage

To run the Max Load simulation, you can use the different functions in the python file to see how this gap changes in different scenareos. 

Examples an explanations of the results are given in the pdf report file.
